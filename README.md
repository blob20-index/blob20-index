## Blob20-Index

Blob20-Index is an indexer for Blob-20 tokens, which originated from Blobscriptions (Ethscriptions ESIP-8). It is developed using Go and MySQL 8.0. The Blob-20 protocol was created by @wgw_eth, and our indexer fully complies with the standards set by @wgw_eth for the Blob-20 token protocol.

### Features
- Fully compatible with the Blob-20 token protocol
- Developed using Go for excellent performance
- Uses MySQL 8.0 for stable and reliable data storage
- Provides simple and easy-to-use API interfaces for seamless integration with other applications

### Installation

- Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/blob20-index/blob20-index.git
    ```

- Navigate to the project directory:
